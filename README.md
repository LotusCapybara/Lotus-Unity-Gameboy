The game on Screen is Pokeom Red (USA) from Nintendo. I own the originals of all the games I tried.

## About

Lotus Gameboy Emulator is a personal project Gameboy Emulator made just for fun and educational purposes. 

I made it over a long weekend in which I challenged my self to be able to load Pokemon, Zelda and Tetris and listen their fantastic songs.
I managed to do it, so I'm happy now! 

## LCD Shaders

I also added 2 LCD shaders, (the very old screen panel and one of the back lit versions).

## Features

  - Gameboy Emulator
  - MBC0, 1 and 3. Although I didn't test them in depth, I only implemented what was needed to load the mentioned games.
  - Custom Screen Shaders
  - Simple Debug Panels and options

## Disclaimer

This project doesn't intend to be a fully fledged emulator, I don't recommend to use it to play games.
It's lacking of many important features like save/load game, support for many cart types, it's full of bugs.. and so on.

My goal was to make it within the constrains of a few days and make the lcd shader as an extra.
